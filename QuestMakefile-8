## This is a makefile for the Quest game.
## This makefile demonstrates how to use the 
## vpath directive inside a makefile.
##
## This makefile assumes that the header 
## files i.e. defs.h and AI.h are inside
## a sub-directory named 'include' under
## the 'Quest' directory. The C source
## files are directly inside the 'Quest'
## directory as usual.

## Override the values of 
## special variables
CC = gcc

## Object files
OBJS = main.o single-player.o AI.o multi-player.o

## For header files, look inside 
## sub-directory 'include' under
## the current directory
INCLUDE_DIR = include
vpath %.h $(INCLUDE_DIR)

Quest: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) -o Quest $(OBJS)
	@echo "The making of the Quest executable is completed."

## Define a pattern rule.
## The 'vpath' directive helps 'make' to find the header files.
## But it does not help 'gcc' to do so.
## Therefore, 'gcc' will require the -I flag followed by 
## the relative path to the header files.
%.o: %.c defs.h AI.h
	$(CC) -c $< -I$(INCLUDE_DIR)

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	rm *.o
